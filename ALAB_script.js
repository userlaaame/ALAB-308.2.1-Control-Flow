//PART 1: "GROWING PAINS" 
// BASICALLY IF ELSE

// Your task is to create a program that advises a group of environmental scientists how to
// handle the growth and spread of a unique plant species under their supervision. 
// You must develop a growth control system that will monitor and predict the plant growth, 
// making decisions based on the available space and potential growth.
// Here is the information you have been given:
// The area in which the plants are contained is circular, with a radius of 5 meters.
// The formula for calculating the area of a circle is PI multiplied by the radius, squared:
// const PI = 3.1415;
// const area = PI * radius * radius;
// Each plant requires a minimum space of 0.8 square meters.

const PI = 3.1415;
const radius = 5;
//minimum space of a single plant
const plant = 0.8;
const area = PI * radius * radius
//starting number of plants
let plantcount = 20;
const capacity = area / plant

console.log('Area: ', area)

console.log(plant + radius);

if (true) {
    console.log('Prune')
} else if (true) {
    console.log('Monitor')
} else {
    console.log('Planted')
}
// The area is starting with 20 plants.
// The plants double in number every week.
// Using this information, your objectives are to:
// Predict the plant growth after a specific number of weeks.
// Implement control flow to make decisions on whether the plants should be:
// Pruned, to stop them from exceeding the capacity of the garden.

// This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is greater 
// than 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden.

// Monitored, if they are growing at an acceptable rate.
// This condition should be met if the plant count is between 50% and 80% of the 
// maximum capacity of the garden after the given number of weeks.

// Planted, if there is room to plant more plants.
// This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of
//  weeks is less than 50% of the maximum capacity of the garden.
// Within your submission, include the results for 1, 2, and 3 weeks of growth as inputs.//
